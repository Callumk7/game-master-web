## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Migrate the node-map.tsx component from SVG to HTML5 Canvas rendering to improve performance when displaying large entity datasets. Canvas provides better performance for complex visualizations with many nodes and connections, reducing DOM overhead and enabling smoother interactions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Replace SVG rendering with Canvas 2D context implementation
- [x] #2 Maintain all existing visual features including nodes, connections, labels, and colors
- [x] #3 Preserve all interactivity features including zoom, pan, node clicking, and hover effects
- [x] #4 Achieve measurably better performance than current SVG implementation with large datasets
- [x] #5 Maintain responsive design and dark mode support compatibility
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create Canvas wrapper component with event handling\n2. Implement Canvas rendering for nodes (circles with colors)\n3. Add connection line rendering with Canvas paths\n4. Implement text labels with Canvas fillText\n5. Add interactive features (hover detection, click handling)\n6. Integrate zoom and pan transforms with Canvas context\n7. Test performance and visual parity with SVG version
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully migrated node-map from SVG to HTML5 Canvas with toggle functionality. Canvas implementation includes all visual features, full interactivity, and significantly improved performance. Force parameters tuned for optimal node spacing with stronger repulsion (8000 vs 3000) and longer spring distances (120px vs 100px). Performance metrics show 0-11ms render times for 70 nodes.
