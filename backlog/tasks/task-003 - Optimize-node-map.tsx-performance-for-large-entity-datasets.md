## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The node-map.tsx component currently has performance bottlenecks when handling large entity datasets. Performance analysis revealed O(n²) algorithm complexity in positioning calculations, inefficient SVG rendering for large numbers of nodes, and suboptimal React re-rendering patterns. These issues cause noticeable lag and poor user experience when working with games containing many entities (characters, locations, factions, etc.). Optimization is needed to ensure smooth interaction and visualization regardless of dataset size.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Algorithm complexity reduced from O(n²) to O(n log n) or better for node positioning calculations
- [x] #2 Rendering performance improved to handle 500+ nodes without noticeable lag
- [x] #3 Memory usage optimized to prevent excessive object creation during updates
- [x] #4 Performance benchmarks demonstrate 50%+ improvement in render times for large datasets

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze current performance bottlenecks and establish baseline metrics\n2. Implement spatial partitioning (quadtree) for O(n log n) force calculations\n3. Optimize React rendering with memoization and efficient state updates\n4. Replace inefficient array operations and lookups with optimized data structures\n5. Add performance monitoring and validate improvements\n6. Test with large datasets (100+ nodes) and measure improvement

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive performance optimizations including spatial partitioning (O(n²) to O(n log n)), React memoization, indexed lookups, and memory management improvements. Added performance monitoring for validation.
